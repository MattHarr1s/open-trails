		<h1>Shawn Steady Shawn</h1>
			<!-Paragraph explaining shawn's persona and use case scenarios->
				<p>Shawn is a 38 year old single male. A financial adviser by day, Shawn never jumps into the deep end, instead
				preferring to get comfortable in the shallow end before wading deeper into life experiences. When a new novelty grabs the
				reigns of Shawn's attention it doesn't let go until Shawn has tried the new activity. Whether it's gardening or skiing, not a single shovel
				or pole is lifted until Shawn completes several hours of internet research from his two primary devices:
				</p>
					<!-List of Shawn's Devices>
					<ol>
						<!-iPhone 5s Primary device for researching new interests->
						<li>iPhone 5s 16 GB</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Screen size: 4 inch screen</li>
								<li>Screen resolution: 1136 x 640</li>
								<li>Storage capacity: 16 GB</li>
								<li>GSM Radio: 4G LTE</li>
								<li>Carrier: AT&T</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Shawn is rarely found without his trusty iPhone 5s. The 4 inch screen is the perfect balance between
						viewability and functionality and Shawn does everything from it. Siri and Shawn are on a first name
							basis with Siri often giving Shawn reccomendations for restaurants, movies and other activities.
							When Shawn needs to know something right away his iPhone has the reliability he requires to always
						have information at glance, without unexpected hiccups keeping him from the knowledge he craves.</p>
						<!-Macbook Air Secondary Device used for web surfing, social media, banking, travel, shopping as well
						as document creation and book keeping->
						<li>Macbook Air 13.3"</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Intel Core i5 1.6GHz</li>
								<li>13.3" 1440x900 LED Backlit Display</li>
								<li>128GB SSD Flash Storage</li>
								<li>Mac OS X Yosemite</li>
							</ul>
						<p>When his iPhone just isn't powerful enough for the task, Shawn opens up his Macbook and performs
						serious work on the 13'3 inch HD display. The core i5 1.6ghz processor is plenty powerful for the times
						Shawn needs to edit photos, update his financial spreadsheets, or create a sample portfolio for a
						potential client. Shawn also enjoys surfing the web and learning about new hobbies from the beautiful
						1440 x 900 LED Backlit Display.</p>
