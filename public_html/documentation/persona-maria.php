			active for most of her life. She has a very successful career in Parks and Recreation. She has also been an
			editor for mountain biking and hiking magazines in the past. Through her career and various side projects,
			Maria has gained a proficient understanding of computers. She is also comfortable using smartphones and
			tablets to browse the internet and use apps. Maria primarily uses a laptop running Windows 7 for most of her
			internet needs.Maria is currently looking for a way to be more active in supporting the hiking community of
			Albuquerque.Unfortunately, she has a busy schedule and can only devote five or six hours a week for these
			activities. After much consideration, Maria decides to volunteer to become an admin user on the open trails
			website. With her first-hand knowledge of the trail network in the local area, she is able to help update information
			about even obscure trails. Maria can also help moderate other account users uploaded information (review
			comments and other information for correctness and appropriateness) for each of the trails and can be a public
			spokesperson for open trails to help recruit more users to the site.
