	<!-Text of ABQ Open Trails Executive summary->
	<p>ABQ Open Trails will be a website for hikers and mountain bikers, used primarily as a way to find trail maps
		and pertinent information, both official and crowd-sourced, to meet the needs of hikers and mountain bikers of
		all abilities from novice to expert.  Non-registered users will be able to search for specific hikes and/or
		mountain bike rides by area, level of difficulty, amenities, elevation gain, and length (distance).
		For each hike or ride, they will also be able access trail information uploaded by registered users, including
		ratings, comments, and photos. They will also see current weather conditions and trail closure updates.  In
		addition, registered users will be able to arrange meet-ups, set up a current hike/ride group, share information
		with friends, and build a trail map for future use.  There will also be a section containing Tips, Tricks,and
		General Information for users wishing to increase their hiking or mountain biking proficiency.
