		<h1>Dangerous Devin</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining Devin's persona and use case scenarios->
		<p>Devin is a 32 year old single male who lives life by nobody's rules but his own. A man of many hats,
			Devin is constantly looking for a new challenge, and a new opportunity to talk about it. Devin is always on his
			Droid Turbo sharing photos from the the diverse locals he is often found at, such as a movie set,
			a wrestling tournament or a brutal hike. Devin broadcasts his adventures from two primary devices:</p>

			</ul>
			<p>When his Droid Turbo just isn't powerful enough for the task, Devin opens up his HP Envy Ultrabook and performs
				serious work on the 14.1 inch HD display. The core i5 1.6ghz processor is plenty powerful for the times

				potential client. Devin also enjoys surfing the web and learning about new hobbies from the beautiful
				1440 x 900 LED Backlit Display.</p>
