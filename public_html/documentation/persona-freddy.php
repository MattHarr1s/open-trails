		<h1>Freddy the Potential Hiker</h1>
		<p>This user, Freddy, is an expert hiker. He is a 30 year old male with no familial attachments. On any given weekday, Freddy can be found in a cubicle, slaving away. Freddy views the ABQ-Open-Trails website on his work computer, running Windows 10 and Firefox. While his job prevents him from forming meaningful relationships with other human beings, it allows him ample time on weekends and the financial capacity to participate in extended hikes in his area. Freddy views his hikes as a respite from the world of technology and as such, does not bring his phone with him on his ventures into the wilderness.</p>
